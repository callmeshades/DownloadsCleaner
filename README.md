*USE THIS APPLICATION AT YOUR OWN RISK*

Applications creates folders based off FileTypes.json.

It takes the key for each JSON object. Checks if a folder with that key exists, if not it will create it. After this is done for all keys in the JsonTypes file it will proceed to check all files in the current users download folder.

Files are moved based on the children of each JSON object. For example in the key "Images" if a file in your folder has the "png" extension it will be moved. It will be moved from the main Downloads folder into the "Images" folder created by the application based off the parents key.

This application is as is, where is. You use this at your own risk.
